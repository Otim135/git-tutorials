# BMI calculator

In this project, we're going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurements:

1. Weight(Kgs)

2. Height(m)

BMI= Weight/(Height* Height)

We'll use the BMI to determine whether the user is:
a) Overweight

b) Normal

c) UnderWeight

# Results Interpretation

If BMI is > 25 Overweight

if BMI is < 18 Underweight

If BMI is between 18 -25 Normal
